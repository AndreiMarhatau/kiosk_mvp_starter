# General rules
* Do not leave any unused code
* Do not leave any comments - instead make smaller classes and functions to improve readability
* Any feature should be unit-tested
* Components should be small enough to be able to efficiently cover them with unit tests
* README file should be up to date
* Run tests to ensure the code works and tests pass
